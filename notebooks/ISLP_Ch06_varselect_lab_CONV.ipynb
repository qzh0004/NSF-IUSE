However, you will not see `scale` or `ssr`, which stands for Sum of Squared Residuals. `ssr` is the same as RSS or Residual Sum of Squares in your textbook.

Then you can estimate $\\sigma^2$ by `res.ssr/(n-p)` where `n` (# of samples) and `p` (# of parameters) should be obtained from `n,p=X.shape`.
