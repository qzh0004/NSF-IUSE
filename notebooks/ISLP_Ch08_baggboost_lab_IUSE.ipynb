        "\n",
        "1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation):\n",
        "\n",
        "**RandomForestClassifier**: This is a widely used ensemble classifier that trains multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data (with replacement) and aggregates their predictions through voting (classification) or averaging (regression).\n",

        "**GradientBoostingRegressor**: Similar to GradientBoostingClassifier, but used for regression tasks.\n",
